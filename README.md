# Activity 1.1.7

## What does this program do, and who is it for?
This program is built using the turtle module and a custom helper class for the turtles, called CustomTurtle. This class contains all the shapes for the turtles, as well as multiple colors that the turtle can be. This class also controls the actual turtle object, but all logic for controlling it is interfaced through CustomTurtle. This program is for people who may need help with object oriented coding and interfacing, so this project can serve as a reference.

## Features
1. CustomTurtle class
2. lots of helper functions
3. Example implementations of using CustomTurtle (Octanotagon and the line thing)

## Questions about the activity
I didn't have any questions about the activity as I worked.
